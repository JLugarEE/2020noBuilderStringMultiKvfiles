This is the basic concept of what I have for the GUI.  Main screen being like a home/landing page and more screens and functions being
built separately. Such a simple concept that gets complicated by Class declarations and the Py and Kv file types needing to work
with the Screen Manager. Tough for a newbie. Some veterans (YouTubers) may have decided to give up, or deem it impossible. 

KivyMD is showing some very good progress. This split and my intended usage will be helpful assuming this task is possible. Hope this 
helps. And you ES are successful.
