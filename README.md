# 2020noBuilderStringMultiKvfiles
Split kivy commands in project files screens\receive.py and screens\send.py into separate kv files to work with main.py and main.kv

"good" folder uses the builder_load_string method and is the intent, but using kv files for the send and receive screens.

"noGud" folder is my attempt to split them into kv files.
